  I am Kaman,<br /> Crafting My Journey in Software Development`;

export const introduction = `
  Hi! I'm an aspiring <strong>software developer</strong> excited about full-stack
  development. Currently, I'm focused on building responsive, user-friendly web
  applications using <strong>React, TypeScript, Node.js, MongoDB,</strong> and
  <strong>CSS Tailwind</strong>. While my current focus is front-end development,
  I'm equally interested in back-end work. I'm driven by real-world problem-solving
  and innovative digital solutions, and I'm committed to continuously growing my
  skills and making meaningful contributions in the tech industry.
